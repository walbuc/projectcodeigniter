## Introduction

CodeIgniter Bootstrap kick starts the development process of the web development process by including Twitter Bootstrap into CodeIgniter. It also includes certain libraries such as AWS and Facebook in-case you are developing applications requiring those SDKs.
So stop writing the same code over again and start working on your idea.

## Installation

Derived from CodeIgniter, read [CodeIgniter Installation](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/installation/index.html) for how to install using this [zipball](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/zipball/master) instead. If you're not familiar with CodeIgniter, I suggest reading the [CodeIgniter Tutorial](http://codeigniter.com/user_guide/tutorial/index.html) on how to get started and read the [wiki](https://github.com/sjlu/CodeIgniter-Bootstrap/wiki) for more information.
